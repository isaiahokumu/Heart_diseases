❤️ Heart Disease Analysis & Quiz App
📌 Overview
This project is an interactive heart disease analysis and quiz application built using Streamlit.
It uses the UCI Heart Disease dataset to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), visualize medical insights,
and engage users with a Kahoot-style cardiology quiz.

🧠 Problem Statement
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide.
By analyzing patient medical records, we aim to:

Understand risk patterns

Identify key medical indicators

Encourage public awareness through an interactive quiz

❓ Research Questions
How is heart disease distributed among patients?

What is the relationship between maximum heart rate and age?

How is fasting blood sugar distributed?

How are major vessels distributed?

What is the distribution of resting blood pressure?

Are there gender differences in heart disease prevalence?

🎯 How the Quiz Works
Select your name and start the quiz.

Each question must be answered as quickly as possible for higher points.

Scores are calculated:

100 points max per question if answered instantly

Minimum 10 points if slow but correct

Final scores are stored in leaderboard.csv and a PDF leaderboard.
